# Day 5 Flex Panel Gallery

## Difficulties:

CSS transitions and transform properties have always been a hard topic for me. This challenge will take more time then I would like to complete. But through reading documentation for each property I know I can find the solution.

- I am simply making a commit today to show that my repo is active and that I am actively taking steps to improve my skills as a developer.

## Update:

- Completed Flex Panel Gallery, although transform css after clicking on eventListenter a second time does not close
  `panel` `div` and `texts` the same as the solution html.

- I will continue to update this at a later date however in order to not fall behing in challenges I will continue to the next challenge.
