# Day 4 - Array Cardio Day 1

## Objective:

Working with array methods to filter and manipulate the array of objects provided.
Array methods to used:

- filter()
- map()
- sort()
- reduce()

## Reflection/Difficulties Faced:

- understanding the reduce() method was difficult, reading documenation and reviewing examples helped me understand how to use the redce method to add the same value of items in an array and log how many instances of it exist.
- Reading documentation in general for each item is more harder to understand than viewing the examples provided on the Mozzilla webpage.
